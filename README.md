# DS_Project2

This is my Project 2 for Database Design. This is a mongodb documentaiton style database about the videogame Madden. The JSON files are all the collections that I made using data from Madden to get me the attributes I needed for all the players, and create my collections. At the bottom of this git I have my querys that highlight the functionality of my database.
